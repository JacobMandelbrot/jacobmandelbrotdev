                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>
                    A co-located mixed reality game prototype built using Meta Spatial Anchors for a fast-paced multiplayer experience. Won the Game Prototyping track at MIT Reality Hack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players compete to catch the most fish from their own boats, each equipped with four stations: a Spear Barrel for spawning throwable spears, a Fish Net for capturing fish, a Bank chest for scoring deposited fish, and a Cannon for launching special effect fish at opponents. Fish spawn between the two boats with varying point values, and some have special abilities that can be used against the opponent. The first player to score 40 points wins.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built all four player stations and the fish movement and interaction systems.</li>
                    <li>Contributed to co-located mixed reality networking.</li>
                    <li>Designed as a foundation for future expansion with more fish variants, game modes, team sizes, and full VR or advanced mixed reality support.</li>
                </ul>
